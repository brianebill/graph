`To take your new skills into production, you are going to need to meet the requirements of your current applications. Our current applications likely allow for file transfer between the client and the server. Our current applications might use WebSockets to push real-time data updates to our clients. Our current APIs are secure and protect against malicious clients. To work

We begin by taking two more iterations in the PhotoShare API.
First, we incorporate subscriptions and real-time data transport.
Second, we allow users to post photos by implementing a solution for file transport with GraphQL.

After weâ€™ve completed these iterations on the PhotoShare application, we will look at ways to secure our GraphQL API to guard against malicious client queries. We wrap up this chapter by examining ways in which teams can work together to effectively migrate to GraphQL.`
